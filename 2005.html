    <p><b>Hello Aiden,</b><br><br>
Today I felt okay. The weekend, the loneliest part of every week, has passed. I slept late last night. I was thinking of you again, while hugging my Build-A-Bear teddy bear. I got out of bed later than expected, but it’s okay! I think instead of uploading each journal entry before I go to bed, I should upload them around 10pm for you so you can read them before you sleep. Do you think that will be better? I know you won’t be able to answer my question, but I will try to do this tomorrow. Perhaps I will write you summaries of my days at school, or at least prior to 5pm. And the following day, I will write whatever happened the previous evening and the beginning of my day. <br><br>
	
	At school today I met up with my friends in the library. We sat at the tables again. I was gushing about you to Gwen, who asked if we were still talking. I told her how much I missed you and she was like ‘why don’t you just talk to him’ LMAO. We should, but I think not talking will make us stronger in a way. During Latin, we reviewed for our upcoming PALs exam. It’s next class. I am confident I will get a perfect score, because Latin is my easiest class and last year I got a perfect score as well! It will be okay. Later I went to advisory, where we watched campaign videos for students running for leadership positions. <br><br>

	During programming, I did some studying for my HTML/CSS exam on Wednesday. It was an easy day, and I spent the end of class studying for my AP exam. We had a fire drill at the beginning of chemistry, and I helped my teacher take attendance. After the fire drill we went over ideal and real gases, and the molecular volume of gases. Pretty fun! I already knew all of this but that’s okay. I love to answer my teacher’s questions! After school I made you the long Hearstopper reference playlist happily :) and I was so happy to find that you made one in response when I found out you did. I am so in love with you :))) <br><br>

	I sat outside with my mother waiting for Sam to come home from school. My mother said that we would be driving to Huntley Meadows in order to prepare for her drive there for a field trip with Sam. I ate this peanut butter chicken that my dad made which was so weird. I couldn’t handle the overwhelming taste of peanut butter so I put hot sauce on it to drown it out. I also ate ice cream and drank lots of water! When my dad came home, we all drove to Huntley Meadows. By the way, I didn’t tell you yet but I got my learner’s permit for driving already. I got a perfect score on my test last Saturday which was awesome. But we were on our first break then so I never told you. <br><br>

	I had so much fun at Huntley Meadows. We went during sundown, so there were many beautiful birds I heard and saw: The Red-Winged Blackbird, the Tree Swallow, Great Blue Heron, Barn Swallow, Canada Goose, Great Egret, and guess what!!! I saw a family of geese :) There was a cute little gosling with its parents next to it hiding in the pond. They looked so so cute. You know, whenever I see cute families of animals, I think of us. I think of us and our future kids. One day, we will be those animals. <br><br>

	After going birding at Huntley Meadows, my parents got donuts and coffee for us at Krispy Kreme. It turns out that Dolly Parton has her own donuts at the place. It’s really funny, she has these yellow and pink colored donuts available for a limited time. I drank iced coffee with it. Getting back home, I wrote another essay for English and studied for government. I also watched a movie with my mom about this creepy couple, it was a suspenseful movie! I’ll be going to sleep now, I am so tired. I’ll try updating you earlier tomorrow! Make sure to check my website before going to bed. I love you so much. I took 12,000 steps today! Nature is so beautiful, but not as beautiful as you. I hope you sleep well my love.<br><br>
