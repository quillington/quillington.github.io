        Aiden,<br><br>
	
	I spent all day today working on your website. I awoke early in the morning, at around 4:45. In the morning, Sam started to feel really sick, and was coughing/blowing her nose a lot. Because of this, my dad and I took her to the minute clinic, which is located where my mom works. While my dad was inside the room with her, I looked around the store cause I wanted to get something. I couldn’t locate the toy section! Where did it go? I went straight to the stationary section because I wanted to get new pens. Sadly the pens were all really expensive, which is typical. I was hoping they’d be on sale. But on the bright side, I bought two memo pads which were 31 cents each. Very cheap! I should’ve gotten more… One was orange and the other was yellow. My two favorite colors! They’re the brightest of them all, and I like bright, sunny things!<br><br> 

	My sister tested positive for strep throat. I’m not really sure what that is but hopefully she gets better. I said hi to some of my mom’s coworkers (they’ve known me since I was little). Upon leaving my mother’s store, we went to Target to go buy Sam a toy. She ended up getting a little backpack and an LOL Surprise ball. I didn’t get anything. We went to eat brunch at IHOP afterwards, which is in the vicinity of the Target. I ate scrambled eggs, hashbrown, sausage and a pancake. It was very good, I also ordered a hot to drink with it. I don’t like when restaurants make their beverages too hot, it’s as if they put water in my drinks as soon as it boils! It burns my tongue and is too hot it can be overwhelming. <br><br>

	When we got home, I worked more on my website. I had lost about an hour and a half by accompanying my dad and sister while they were out, but that’s okay. I felt bad all day today because I didn’t walk much. I was either on the couch or on the table working on my laptop. At least it was for you, otherwise I wouldn’t forgive myself. Well, I guess if I was studying I would also forgive myself. I will make up for not walking today by passing my goal of 12,000 steps tomorrow. <br><br>

	I made a new podcast for you, but I don’t know what else I will include on it honestly. I was thinking, maybe I could teach you about birds on my podcast? Maybe I should make a podcast specifically about birds, for any audience. Do you think I could make money out of that? I’m not sure how monetization works. I would make you any podcast for free. Let me know if you would listen to me teach you about birds. I’m not sure where I would start.<br><br>
	
	Around 5pm I started preparing for your birthday present. I recorded my podcast episode with my happy birthday message, and got the final few details of the three website pages complete. The other few pages will be updated shortly, so stay tuned. Additionally, I want to password protect this website so only you can view it. I will add a login page shortly. <br><br>
	 
	I hope you are doing well. I miss you so much it’s crazy!!! Also I really, really hope you love this website. Maybe it will lift your spirits. I really hope that you can remember me from just clicking on it. I’m sorry for not completing the website. I probably should have spent more time on it. My priority right now is to find a way to code the ‘send a message’ section, but I’m not sure how long this will take. It’s a complicated process trying to figure out how to do this alone. If I don’t update frequently, it is because my exams are coming up as well. I’ll be doing quite a bit of studying these next few days. <br><br>

	I love you. Have a great day tomorrow.<br><br>
