    <h5>May nineteenth, 2024</h5>
    <p><b>Happy birthday, my love</b><br><br>
	I woke up happily today remembering that you’re now sixteen! How awesome is the passage of time? Another day closer to reuniting. I awoke at around 6:00 today, going downstairs with my sister to eat breakfast. We ate leftover pizza from yesterday. I spent my morning on my laptop listening to music. <br><br>

I watched the youtube live stream of your church service. I remember when you first got that green dress you were wearing. You sent me a video of you in the fitting room trying it on. I must say, you look very handsome in it. I smiled the whole time I saw you up there singing. I can hear the sound of your voice apart from everyone else’s singing at the same time, which is pretty nice. I like to dissect music that way, separating the sounds of each instrument or voice that is singing. I only listen to yours. <br><br>

I checked your church’s Facebook for old photos and videos of you. You are so beautiful. I saw ones from 2022, when your hair was shorter. You have always been so beautiful. I like your hair now, but I know you don’t feel like yourself when it’s long that way. Me neither. If you cut your hair sometime between now and Halloween, please take photos and send them to me when you can. I love how handsome you look when you’re you.<br><br>

Later, I watched an old Mexican film with my dad. It was pretty funny, about these two guys who became performers at a circus. We both fell asleep at the conclusion of the movie, but that’s alright. Then, I began to study a bit for my government exam which is this Friday. Not sure how I’ll do, I probably won’t sleep much the next few nights. I asked my dad if we could go birding at a nearby park, and he agreed to take Sam and I.<br><br>

We went to Oxon Hill Cove and Farm, which was so nice! It’s about ten minutes away from the house. There’s a grand forest near the farm, and I saw so many swallows and swifts! They fly so fast, but I particularly heard the tree swallow. They’re the birds in our matching profile pictures on Whatsapp. Last we texted, you removed that picture. I kept mine, just to let you know. Anyway, we saw farm animals like chickens, cows, horses, and pigs. There was even a goat that I heard and probably some sheep in a nearby pasture. They’re all so cute. There was a baby horse with two big horses in the stalls. I thought of us, they’re a little family :)  <br><br>

I wanted to go to the cove through a trail, but Sam didn’t want to walk anymore. While walking back to our car, I saw the Eastern Kingbird through my binoculars, and I saw a Black Heron flying so close to me! I saw its neck, curved inwards as well as its cute legs tucked in while it was flying. I was happy somewhat – if only Sam hadn’t stopped the trip. She prefers to stay inside and watch her tablet all day rather than go outside and witness the beauty of nature. I hope that one day she learns to appreciate it. Nature is so beautiful! <br><br>

As time went on and we got back home, I started to feel bad. I miss you so much, Aiden. I’m sorry I wasn’t able to spend your birthday with you. I wish I could have. I’m not sure what you did instead of talking to me today. Maybe your friends wished you a happy birthday and you had fun talking or calling all day. I’m not sure. Maybe if you write a summary I will know. I hope you had a lot of fun and felt appreciated today. In the future, I will put maximum effort into wishing you a happy birthday each year, taking you somewhere nice or doing whatever you want with you. If you want to stay inside with me all day, I’ll gladly do that :) <br><br>
	
I studied a bit for government some more in the evening and watched many episodes of Brooklyn 99. I thought of you. I also imagined us cuddling today, which was relaxing. I imagined the gifts I would give you for your birthday in the future. I don’t know how much longer I can go without you. This is so crazy! I know that it’s necessary for us to take time apart but I miss you so so much. I don’t know how to express this in words. I wish I could hold you right now. I wish I could spoon you at night while we sleep. I want to hear your breathing and feel your heartbeat against mine.<br><br>

Do you hug your teddy bear at night and think of me? I know I do. Sometimes I fold one of my pillows or blankets into an ellipsoid in order to synthesize a human-like form. I really want to talk to you again. This is why I am working on my website more, so I can make a message-sending part of it. I’m not sure how, because it may be too complex. I will try anyway for you. This will take about a week for me to do, and I will be busy this entire week. Please wait for me. If you don’t want to wait, please email or text me your daily summaries. <br><br>

I want to talk to you, even if we’re just friends in love for now. I want to know about your day, and whether or not you thought of me. I want to see and hear you say you love me just one more time. It’s only been four days. I’m counting down the days until Halloween when we will reunite. 165 days is far too much. Do you think we should have a zoom call ready for Halloween? I’ll make one once we get closer to it. For now, I miss you so so much. I’m not sure how you’re holding up right now. <br><br>

Is it healthy for us to talk even though we’re broken up right now? I think the best option is to just share the summaries of our days like this instead of texting each day. But I really do want to text you anyway. I want to tell you everything I feel every day! I know I’m already doing this through these journal entries, but I wish I could tell you in the moment how I’m doing. I love you so much. I hope your sixteenth birthday went very well. What gifts were you given? You should tell me when you can. I love you, I hope you’re sleeping well now. <br><br>
