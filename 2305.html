    <p><b>Hi Aiden,</b><br><br>
 I spent my afternoon yesterday studying. At night, my mother and I watched a Filipino movie about these two kids getting kidnapped. It was so sad, but it was a movie without dialogue and I really liked it. I didn’t even realize it didn’t have dialogue until the Netflix message at the end. It was an enjoyable movie. I went to sleep rather late, because I continued to study even after the movie ended.        <br><br>
In the morning, I woke up to watch the sun rise. Unfortunately, I did not have the energy to go on a morning walk. Today I have cramps, and I felt tired the entire school day. I got ready in the morning and ate my breakfast, which was hot chocolate with bread. At the library I met my friends, and I forgot what we talked about. I was thinking of you, that is all I remember. During maths, we had time to study for our final exam. I did some studying and went to my government class, where we discussed the remaining amendments of the bill of rights (7-10). We also finished watching the video about supreme court Justice Black. <br><br>
We peer-edited each others essays in English. I finished peer editing two, but we need to complete four by tomorrow. Because I am taking my exam tomorrow and won’t be in my English class, I’ll have to make it up on Tuesday after school. Peer editing was really fun, but also a bit boring. I wished we did something more fun today instead. It’s okay though! In economics, I studied for my government exam some more by reading the required documents. On the bus ride home, I almost fell asleep! I was so exhausted by today, and I still am. I apologize for my letter being so short. <br><br>
I will try my best to get good sleep tomorrow night, because tonight I will likely spend studying for my exam tomorrow. It is not expected of us to ace it, but I want to at least earn college credit from it. Hopefully I do well! Please wish me luck :) I wish you luck on every upcoming exam of yours! Exams are so fun. I love them. Anyway, goodnight now, my love. I will write to you again tomorrow. My parents said that we are going to eat dinner at my favourite Peruvian restaurant, so I’m very excited! I have been craving food. I ate chocolate today, which people running for the student government association are handing out. Hopefully I can get some donuts or cookies from them tomorrow, which is the last day of the election. Sleep well tonight. I love you dearly.
