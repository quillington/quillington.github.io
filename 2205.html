    <h5>May twenty second, 2024</h5>
    <p><b>Hi my love,</b><br><br>
Yesterday was so great. After Sam came home from school, her friend Alisha came over for a playdate. I sat outside with my parents to watch them, and later went on a walk to see my friends. The sun was glowing very brightly! I was so happy. I walked three laps around the path, and saw a few beautiful birds. I was so happy! The moon shone brightly, though it was still light outside. It’s almost full — there’ll be a full moon on the night of the twenty third. You remind me a lot of the moon, especially because you and me are on opposite sides of the ocean separating us. One day, we’ll meet. One day we’ll be together, like the closeness of the sun and moon when the phase is new. I love you. Anyway, I was so happy, I was smiling the entire time on my walk. I love my birds a lot. I will start to take walks in the early morning. I realize that looking outside through my window, or simply sitting in the grass each morning is not enough. I must go to the water and watch the beautiful birds as the sun first ascends past the horizon.<br><br>

I took a shower after my walk. I was sweaty, because I did that and exercised a bit. My dad was watching Jumanji while I was away, and I finished watching it with him. I studied for my government test while my mother and I finished the suspenseful movie about two moms we partially viewed yesterday. She fell asleep just ten minutes before the big reveal. It was based on a true story, which seems far-fetched. I went to sleep after watching a brief video for my html exam. <br><br>

I set my alarm to 5:20 and woke up still hugging my teddy bear from the night before. When I got up, I ate scrambled eggs with corn and chocolate milk with cake. Yay. It was a good breakfast, and I got ready for school after eating. I met up with my friends in the library and bought some chocolate from Jenna because she’s fundraising for something. I’m not sure. I also looked at our past messages while sitting with them, because I missed you a lot. I smile when I review our messages. You mean everything to me.<br><br>

During Latin today, I took my PALs assessment. It was a story about the woman Cloelia, who was captured along with other ladies by the Etruscan king Lars Porsenna. They were miserable being held captive, so one day they attempted escaping by crossing the Tiber river. They were successful, even after Porsenna’s guards were after them, but later he threatened the Roman government by saying he’d burn down the city if they didn’t return the girls. So, they returned them, and Porsenna scolded them for a second but realized that what they did was so brave! So, he let them go, and Cloelia had a statue built in her honor. The test itself was easy; I spent the majority of my time taking it just translating the passage. Then, I didn’t even have to look at the paper. Reading comprehension and writing in latin is extremely easy. I wish sometimes we would have speaking and listening tests.<br><br>

I went to my maths class afterwards, and studied for my html test today. I passed it — but it would’ve been really funny if I didn’t, as I have created my own website for you. In economics, I studied for Friday’s exam by reading the Constitution in full. I went to lunch directly after, where I sat down listening to your playlist and drawing birds. If I ever published my own album, I would make it a collection of love songs dedicated to you. The cover would be a photo of you so everyone can know who they are for. I don’t think I would write any songs not related to love. Perhaps we could make some songs together. I prefer raw, real versions of songs rather than edited and studio versions. We could include little hidden messages in our songs, the way Alex Hirsch hid his messages in the Gravity Falls episodes. Sorry — I think I have a bit of an obsession with that show. It consumes a noticeable portion of my mind, similar to the way birds do. Perhaps they are both special interests of mine. I think they might be. <br><br>

I took my html/css certification exam during programming and got an 841/1000. Passing score! For my Python exam, I got a 900/1000. I’m glad I am now certified in these two languages. The rest of class I spent studying for chemistry. Chemistry today was great! We went over phase diagrams and molar volume of gasses. I find this unit so fun and easy! Our test is on Friday. My mom got home later than usual, which meant it was up to me to cook rice for dinner. I am now waiting for my sister to come back home. <br><br>

I hope you rest well. I hope you had a wondrous day today! Have many more wondrous days, my love. I miss you, I miss you sosososo much. This time without you is so hard, I keep thinking of you. :( I love you so much, please dream of me tonight. I know that I will. I will imagine the two of us together again, every day until we reunite. I love you so much, Aiden.<br><br>
