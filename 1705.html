    <h5>May seventeenth, 2024</h5>
    <p>Hi Aiden,<br>
	
	Today was a pretty good day. It was my first real day without you, but I felt okay nevertheless. I miss you dearly. I decided to work some more on my website for you today. I didn’t eat breakfast this morning, but I did drink a lot of water today. I woke up late, because I had slept late the previous night. I was up watching a Latino tv show with my mom while she was doing her rx training and I was doing my homework. I can only focus on a task if I am doing multiple things. Multiple distractions are better than just one.<br>

	It was a bit chilly outside this morning. I wore my bomber jacket and baggy jeans, and your ring on my right hand. I heard many birds outside and saw them up close on my walk to the bus stop. I decided that I will be writing about them in my journal, the one that I used to write poems in. There is a lot of space in the journal, and it reminds me of the six-fingered book that Stanford Pines kept to document his findings in Gravity Falls in the show. I will be like him, I always have wanted to be like him, ever since I was little. Unlike my typical routine, I will not be using my field guides or other external sources to guide me. I will solely be using my own time spent around each bird species to determine their behavior, diet, physical appearance, call, breeding months, and migration status. I’ll have to look at the books to determine their range and scientific name – but that’s alright :)<br>
	
	I sat with my friends in the library. I forgot what we talked about. There is someone new who has come to visit us, a friend of Justine’s and Donovan’s. Her name is Ren, with an R unlike the bird. It’s short for Serenity. She showed a photo of her boyfriend and was making fun of him because he looks like Dream. I thought it was a bit mean that her and some of my friends were laughing at him. I would feel bad, but maybe it’s an inside joke for them or something. In math, we took a test on probability distribution and expected values. I think I did well, it was a pretty easy unit but the wording on the questions made it a bit difficult to find what I was looking for. This is why I will be taking analysis next year.<br>

	In government, we learned about the fourth amendment. Not me though, I already did studying on that amendment one or two weeks ago. It protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures. I worked on your website instead. I like to learn about this amendment, I think it’s one of the more interesting ones. It’s about how officers can request a warrant and serve a warrant, it tells which actions of an officer require a warrant or not. So cool! Anyway, my teacher said we had a guest speaker coming in and I was quite intrigued. It turned out to be our school’s security officer, aka a cop who watches over the students in my school. I see him sometimes in the halls or in the mornings as I make my way inside. His name is Officer Ashraf, and he answered our questions regarding searches and seizures, and more about his job. He showed us his taser, pepper spray, baton, and bodycam. He demonstrated handcuffing on my teacher, and demonstrated a search on him too. It was really funny. I have some photos of it, all of us students were laughing. Oh, and along with Officer Ashraf was a rookie Officer Felitez. Latino guy, he’s young, tall and fit. He was called to do something but answered a few questions about probable cause and reasonable suspicion before he left.<br> 
	
	In English, we took the reading inventory. I’m not sure if you take it over there in the UK. it assesses your Lexile score, which is how advanced you are in terms of vocabulary and reading comprehension. The maximum score is 1700, and I always get around 1400-1500. This time I got 1442. I can’t focus on reading the passages for the reading inventory, and a lot of the time I do not know the words given to me as options. I should get a thesaurus sometime. I have a dictionary at home, but a thesaurus is much more important to me, definitely. My teacher talked to everyone about their scores individually. She said it’s okay that I’m fluctuating. I mean, it’s still above grade level so it’s fine, but I’m one of her best writers so it’s okay. I just need to read more. I write a LOT more than I read, which is probably the reason I got that score. After the reading inventory, we read a short story titled ‘Love is a Fallacy’. It’s about this narcissist who believes he is a genius and gets schooled by a girl he thought was ‘dumb’. It’s really funny, and also introduces us to many fallacies. Some of them are in Latin, like ad misericordiam, dicto simpliciter, and post hoc. I know what they all mean just based on their name!<br>

	In economics, I worked harder on your website. I was doing something else on my phone that I actually don’t remember right now. I just remember that for about fifteen minutes, I was distracted by my phone. I guess I’ll never know what it was. Anyway, I was working on the lyrics section this entire school day, because I know how much you value words of affirmation. I’ll have a little message for you on the webpage. OH, now I know what I was doing on my phone! I had been screenshotting more photos for the scrapbook portion of your website. Just more work on your website :) I walked home from my bus stop to find Toby in my front yard. He is very cute. Not as cute as you, though. <br>

	I worked on the website all afternoon and evening. I was supposed to go with my mother and sister to her school’s creativity night, which is where they celebrated the fascinating art and creations from the students. I feel bad, because I didn’t go. My dad didn’t go and I wasn’t exactly sure what would be happening at the creativity night. All I knew was there would be pizza, which is the main reason I initially agreed to attend. I spent my time instead at home with my dad, where we watched a movie on Netflix. It was nice. I like to talk to my dad because we always end up talking about some philosophical subject. When my mother and sister came home, I started working on my website again. My sister and dad went to sleep quickly, but my mother and I were watching a movie called Madame Web. I still don’t really understand the movie. We’ll continue watching tomorrow. <br>

	I wonder how your day went. I hope you had a great one! I noticed you listening to some of our songs on Spotify, which made me happy. I hope you have been taking care of yourself, and I hope your exam on Thursday went well. I’ll be working all day tomorrow on your website. I hope you love it.<br>
Yours,
Q
