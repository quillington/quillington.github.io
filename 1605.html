    <p><b>Aiden,</b><br><br>

	Today was better. I’m glad we were able to finally have a conversation, since our break-up left out so much. My messages likely seemed desperate. I didn’t know what to think after we broke up. I was nervous you didn’t love me anymore. Now, I know it was crazy to think all of that. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, after all. So what if we miss out on twelve months of each other’s lives? We have so much more time after that. I value the passage of time greatly; I think that it can sometimes be a gift. Time for us apart means that we will learn to appreciate each other more once we get back together. <br><br>

	Today, I was really happy. I clutched your ring in my hand all day, playing with it and wearing it. I wear your ring. I happily told my friends that we would be trying again, and they’re happy for me too which is great. In Latin today, we practiced some of our vocabulary and played deal or no deal. It was fun, my team won, yay. Then, I went to programming and decided to do a bit of studying.<br><br>

I checked my phone and realized I had gotten an email back from King’s College. Their entry requirements are very broad – not yet sure if it’s necessary for me to enroll in A-Levels. But I really want to anyway. I realized that King’s might not be the right college for me since it specializes in medicine. I’ve decided to reach out to other nearby colleges – UCL and Imperial College. They may cost a lot, but they’re nearby. Maybe one day we can rent an apartment together, and commute separately to our schools. It’s okay if we don’t take classes together, but at least we can come back to see each other at the end of each day. If for some reason I am unable to get into these English colleges, I will stay in the US and try enrolling in a study abroad program. I’ve made a google document with the pros and cons of each college I’ll be applying to, and whether or not I will be taking a gap year depending on which one I go to. <br><br>

After programming I went to the trailers to review for my AP government exam. We just reviewed the landmark supreme court cases. Then, I went back to programming and studied some more for it. I found pdfs of the textbooks I had wanted to use for studying for the exam. It’s in eight days, hopefully I can cram enough to get a good score. I’m hoping for a 4 or 5. Ideally a 5, the highest score, though that is incredibly unlikely. In chemistry, we reviewed the gas laws and went over the ideal gas equation. Pretty fun, but I already knew all of what we were ‘learning’. My tablemates asked if I am in a relationship. I don’t know why, they are very nosy. I told them I do – not sure if I should have, but I wouldn’t consider myself single. I mean, technically we are broken up, but that does not at all mean I’m available. I definitely amn’t! I told them we’ve been together for one year and nine months. We have. And I still consider every moment from when we fell in love to be a moment where we are together. This is a dilemma. You aren’t my boyfriend right now, but I guess mentally you always will be.<br><br> 

I listened to some nice music as I left school. I sat at the front of the bus, smiling at the window. When I got home, my mom did training for her pharmacist job on my laptop. I studied a bit for my math exam tomorrow, and then ate dinner. After Sam came home and ate dinner, her, my mom, and I went to the park so she could play with her friend. There were a group of people already there, so there were five other kids with us. I took my binoculars with me because I wanted to look at a few birds while we were outside. I was happy to spot a Red Bellied Woodpecker, a bird I don’t see that often but hear all the time! When I walked back home from school earlier in the day, I had also heard it. With my new binoculars, I can see birds so close now. I am very happy. <br><br>
	
After going to the park, my mother and I left Sam with my dad at home and we went walking together while eating ice cream. I took my binoculars with me to go look at some more birds. I met a few of my friends: the Red Winged Blackbirds, House Sparrows, Northern Cardinals, European Starlings, Common Grackles, American Robins, and guess what! I even saw the Northern Rough-Winged Swallow! I saw two of them, but only one was perched still, and I saw it up close through my binoculars. I am very happy. <br><br>

Upon arriving home, I studied more for school tomorrow. It’s Friday, yay. I hope you have a great sixteenth birthday, my love. I will miss not being there for you. Hopefully you spend a good time with your family and friends. I hope you think of me. I will make a new podcast episode just for you. Bye now, love. I’ll be going to sleep soon. I hope you rest well tonight and every other night.<br><br>
        <b>Yours,<br>
