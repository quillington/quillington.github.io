        <h1>A Website For You</h1>
    <p>Hi Aiden, I have decided to continue working on the website I intended
        to program for you. Unfortunately after our break up, I had deleted a
        lot of the information used to program your website. I even stopped the process because
        it hurt too much to think of you. As a result, I am not
        yet done with it. I will update this every day, especially with my daily letters.
        I will continue to update with more song lyrics that remind me of you, and add some
        drawings of mine as photos on here. 
        When we're back together, we can add some more photos and memories
        to our scrapbook. This website will live on. I will be writing you more poems as time 
        goes on, and you
        can simply search my website for you if you're ever thinking of me.
        I'm always here for you. I love you. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I hope you like your website. Think of it as a birthday gift for you, since
        I'll be publishing it on May nineteenth after all. Have a great sixteenth birthday.
        If you see the 'send a message' section: I'll be working on that in the next few days.
        If you ever want to send me your journal entries, or daily summaries of your day,
        I'll read them. You may start writing them now, if you wish, though I won't see them 
        yet. I will soon. I'll read every word you write me. <br><br>
        I'll be seeing you soon.
        </p>
    <br>
