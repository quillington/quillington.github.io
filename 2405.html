    <p><b>Hi my love,</b><br><br>
Yesterday evening, my parents and I drove to our favourite Peruvian restaurant. The food was great, we go to eat there every week or so. It’s fresh when we dine in. After going to the restaurant, we went home and talked about plans to watch the Garfield movie. We’re planning on going tonight, I am very excited. What kind of movies do you think will be released when we have our kids? Hopefully they are good, I hope to see as many movies with them as we can.<br><br>
I tried to pull an all nighter in order to study for my government exam, but I didn’t. Hopefully I do well anyway. I woke up early, and got ready as fast as I could. I ate a pancake for breakfast as well as orange juice. In the library, I sat with my friends and listened to them talk about a game called cards against humanity. It is a game where you fill in the blank, but I’m still not really sure what it’s about. We might play it at the potluck tomorrow, at Justine’s house. (I don’t want to stay there too long. I will go home after two to three hours or so). <br><br>
In Latin, Lydia and I crammed for our government exam. I think our teacher noticed, but she was understanding that we weren’t paying attention to the lesson. Also, the lesson was aimed at the people in our class who don’t do well on assessments. It was review from Latin 1, because some people are performing terribly in this class — they can’t even remember basic vocabulary. I don’t say this to be mean, but that’s what my own teacher told the class. Hopefully they get better at Latin before the final exam! I went to government after, where I crammed before my exam. My teacher wished myself and the other kids in my class taking it ‘good luck’. <br><br>
It is so boring to sit in the testing area while the proctor is giving out directions. My mind prefers quick procedures instead. I didn’t realize it, but my deadname is on my AP testing ticket for CollegeBoard. I didn’t know it would be on there, but it makes sense. We had our lunch break before starting the exam, sitting in the lecture hall was only necessary to fill out identifying documents. During lunch, I sat alone. I wrote some of my letter to you, and listened to your playlist. I also drank water, but didn’t have anything to eat. I crammed a bit before the exam to make sure I remembered everything. <br><br>
The test went well! It was pretty easy, so I hope I did well on it. Results come out in July. The multiple choice portion was rather easy, and I attempted to BS my way through the writing portion. Honestly though, I only struggled with the fourth of four paragraphs. And, I think I still got it correct. The test ended up much longer than I had anticipated it to last. For this reason, I had no one to pick me up after school, or anyone to talk to. My mother was working, and some people went shopping nearby with their friends — but I sat outside waiting for an hour. I am back home now, I apologize for this being so late.
My parents and i are going to watch Garfield soon, after my dad comes back from work. I am excited to watch! I’ll see you tomorrow, my love. I will write to you about my day, because I will be hanging out with my friends for a couple of hours. I will be thinking of you. Sleep well tonight, I hope you dream of the angels. You know, that is a common message we say in Spanish. “Sueña con los angelitos”. I hope you do :) Goodnight now, I love you so much, Aiden. Only 159 more days until Halloween :) So excited for this to be over soon. We will meet again, that's what I keep telling myself each day to get me going.<br><br>
