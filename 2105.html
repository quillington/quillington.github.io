    <p><b>Hi my love,</b><br><br>
This morning I woke up randomly around 4:00. I heard my dad leaving for work at the time, but I struggled to go back to sleep. Instead, I put on our playlist and tried going back to sleep. I love to listen to the songs you put on your playlists for me. I always wonder what they mean! When I finally got out of bed, I started to feel achy because I’m almost on my period sadly. For breakfast, I ate a leftover chocolate donut from yesterday. I got ready quickly and headed to school.<br><br>  
        I clutched your ring a lot today. For some reason it makes me feel a lot closer to you than just having it on my finger. I sat in the library with my friends and felt calm, but somewhat alone while at the table. I miss you so much. I thought of you all day today. I listened to our playlists for each other all day and wrote our initials in my notebooks. During math, we had a substitute. Vivian and I played some virtual escape rooms, similar to the ones we completed once, remember? The one in the pyramids or something, and the pirate ship one. I was thinking of you. You and I would make such a great team in a real escape room. We should go on a date to one, some day. Maybe one day we’ll go with our kids. I also wrote a bit during math. <br><br>
        In government, we learned about the fifth and sixth amendments. Pretty easy material. I think the whole time I was just studying for my exam instead. I paid attention to a bit of what my teacher said, though. I already know about the amendments since I did my research prior to class. In English, we played the fallacy game. I find fallacies so interesting! They’re easy for me to identify and I love the different types. Many of them are in Latin, and I know their literal translations. Wait, I feel as though I have told you this already. I may have written this to you in Friday’s journal entry. Oh well. My team and I did really well, and I found it so easy to identify each fallacy from my teacher’s given example. We even made some of our own, and they were all correct. We won the game, and my teacher said our group deserved candy the most so she gave some to us. Yay! We took a test on fallacies after the game, which was very easy. I loved it. We were allowed to use notes we took during the game, but I didn’t even look at mine. <br><br>
        In economics I studied for government. On the bus ride home, I listened to your playlist for me once more and smiled while staring out the window. It’s now the afternoon and I am awaiting Sam’s arrival. I think I will be going on a walk to the levee during sundown. I am hoping to see a few Swallows and Kingfishers around. I will update you on anything that happens after 5:00pm tomorrow. I'll write all about it in my letter to you. I love you so much. For now, I wanted to wish you a good night. Maybe you will see this before you fall asleep? It’s 9:25pm for you right now and I’ll be uploading this on my website as soon as I finish writing. I’m not sure how long it takes to update, but hopefully soon. I love you, my dear. I hope you sleep very well tonight and I hope nothing bothers you while you rest. I hope your days without me have been alright. I wonder what you have been doing. Maybe you’re spending more of your time studying, or with your friends, or online, or outdoors, even. I’m not sure. But I know we will talk all about it sooner or later. Once again, I love you. Stay safe, my dearest. <br><br>
